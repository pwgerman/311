  <h1>About SF 311 Predictions</h1>

  <h3 class="bump-down">Why we built this:</h3>
  <p>The San Francisco 311 service is an important bridge between citizens and our government.  In a small way, it allows us to feel empowered and heard and capable of improving our city.  This was a natural draw for our team.</p>
  <p>We also love data.  It can tell stories, illuminate problems, rally people around causes, and much more.  We know that the SF311 dataset reflects a rich, interesting political and social landscape and we want to tease meaningful inferences from the data.</p>
  <p>Also, we hope that our analysis will have utility to the City government, and that some of the information we discover will help them operate more transparently and efficiently.

  <h3 class="bump-down">How we built this:</h3>
  <p>The site you're viewing is a simple Flask application using Bootstrap and deployed on Heroku.  For information about the prediction and machine learning available on SF311.info, please see the <a href="/explanation">How it Works</a> page.</p>
